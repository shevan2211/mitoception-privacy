# Mitoception Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-01-01

## Who we are
Mitoception is a research/pilot app. Contact: evan.shaulson@gmail.com

## Data we collect
If you connect WHOOP, we may collect metrics such as sleep, recovery, strain, and related summaries made available through the WHOOP API.

## How we use data
We use the data to power in-app displays and analyses for the pilot/study.

## Data storage
Describe whether data is stored only on-device, or also on a server (and which provider).

## Sharing
We do not sell your data. We only share data with the study team as needed (and de-identified where possible).

## Retention and deletion
We retain data for the duration of the pilot unless you request deletion. To request deletion, email: evan@example.com

## Security
We use industry-standard security practices (e.g., encryption in transit; access controls).

## Disconnecting WHOOP
You can disconnect access at any time. After disconnecting, we stop pulling new data.
